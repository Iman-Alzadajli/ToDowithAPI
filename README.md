## üìö What is JWT?

**JWT (JSON Web Token)** is a compact, URL-safe way to securely transmit information between client and server as a JSON object.  
It is commonly used for authentication:

- After logging in, the server creates a JWT signed token.
- The client stores this token (usually in memory or local storage).
- For every protected request, the client sends the JWT in the Authorization header.
- The server validates the token to authorize the user without needing to check credentials every time.

JWT helps to build stateless, scalable APIs by avoiding server-side session storage.

## üì¶ What is DTO?

**DTO (Data Transfer Object)** is a simple object used to transfer data between layers, especially between the client and server.

- It contains only the data needed for communication.
- It helps to **separate internal data models** from what is exposed externally.
- Makes the API more secure and maintainable by **hiding unnecessary fields**.
- Improves performance by sending only required data.
